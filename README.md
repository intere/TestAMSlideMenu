# TestAMSlideMenu

This project is just a POC to see how the AMSlideMenu control works (in Swift).  It's much better (IMHO) than the ECSliderPanel Control.  This provides a much better UX and it's much easier to implement.

My work here is based on a Youtube tutorial I found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y33t_bWS_Zk
